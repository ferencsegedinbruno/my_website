    "text": "Hi! I am a PhD student in Linguistics at Brown University. I am part of the Cognitve and Psychological Sciences (CoPsy), and the Program in Linguistics, where I am advised by Uriel Cohen Priva.\nBroadly, I am interested in how communicative, phonetic and learning pressures shape languages’ phonological systems, and I primarily use corpus data and computational modeling to address questions related this issue. My dissertation research focuses on quantifying and explaining the extent of nonlocal dependencies between segments across the world’s languages.\nI have a parallel interest in deep learning interpretability, particularly as it relates to modeling the mapping from phonetic/acoustic to phonological representations. Some of my recent work focuses on whether phonological generalizations can be inferred from raw speech data and in particular whether information bottlenecks in deep learning architectures can yield human-like phonological generalizations.\nFeel free to reach out with any questions!"

They also make no assumptions about intermediate representations. However, even relatively simple architectures are black boxes, and their correspondence to linguistic phenomena is often ill-defined.\n\n\nContrasting the role of fully-connected and convolutional layers\nA starting point for building interpretable and plausible models of phonological learning from raw speech is to consider how the architectural constraints of a model correspond to human-like computational constraints. Some of my work focuses on the division of labor between the fully-connected and convolutional layers, and how this can be leveraged to build plausible models."

I use tools like Bayesian regression modeling to answer: is the the distribution of sounds in the world’s lexicon predicted by usage-based or communicative pressures?
