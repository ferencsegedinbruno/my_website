## Co-occurrence constraints in lexicons

Languages' lexicons exhibit categorical rule like behavior. Some sequences are licit, while other are not.

Amont the range of licit sequences, some are more frequent. Does the probability distribution of co-occurrence restriction predicted by usage-based or communicative pressures?

## Phonological Representations in Neural Networks

### (How) are they useful?

An advantage of neural networks for language modeling is their capacity to compress highly variable data in non-linear ways. They also make no assumptions about intermediate representations. However, even relatively simple architectures are black boxes, and their correspondence to linguistic phenomena is often ill-defined.

## Phonetic Adaptation

My Master's work focused on perceptual adaptation to novel accents, and what the statistical aspects of the input are that license certain kinds of adaptations.
